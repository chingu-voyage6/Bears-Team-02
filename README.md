### Rationale for Founder Connect

Non-technical startup founders often lament a lack of funding for their projects because startup investors are reluctant to invest in sole proprietors, particularly if that sole proprietor has no technical skills. We believe a lack of technical skills should not be a hindrance. Therefore, Founder Connect provides non-technical founders with a platform to reach out to technical founders and start working together.
